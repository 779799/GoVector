A ShiViz compatible Logging Library in Go

This is small library you can add to any Go project to create a ShiViz Compatible Log. 

Files Included:

Govec Folder : Contains the Library and all its dependencies 
TestFile : A small program to Test the Library 
exampleprocess-log : An example log generated by library
Experimental Development Folder : A folder containing code used in development of this library and is of no consequence to the user

API Info

The Library Supports 3 Major Calls:

<i>
- Initialize()<br>
- PrepareSend()<br>
- UnpackReceive()<br>
</i>

The calls are explained below

How to Use This Library

<b>Step 0:</b>
To Use This Library, copy the govec folder in your project. In your program, import it by adding this :

	"import ./govec"

to your import list.
	
<b>Step 1:</b>
Create a Global Variable and Initialize it using like this = 

	Logger:= govec.Initialize("MyProcessName",ShouldYouSeeLoggingOnScreen,ShouldISendVectorClockonWire,Debug)
	
- <b>ShouldYouSeeLoggingOnScreen</b> prints whatever is logged by the Library on Standard Output<br>
- <b>ShouldISendVectorClockonWire</b> should be true if all involved Networked Program are also using this library and false if
only you are logging on this locally running program<br>
- <b>Debug</b> prints extra information on Standard Output<br>

Note : You can pass the Logger variable into a function to call it.
	
<b>Step 2:</b>
When Ever You Decide to Send any []byte, call PrepareSend and send output. 
So instead of:

	connection.Write([]YourMessage)
call :

	connection.Send(PrepareSend("Message Description", []YourMessage))

In this case <b>[]YourMessage</b> are the bytes you are trying to send

<b>Step 3:</b>
When Receiveing a []byte Message, Unpack it with UnpackRecieve Call. 
So after you call :

	connection.Read([]RecievedBuffer)
call :
	
	[]UnpackedMessage :=  UnpackReceive("Message Description", []ReceivedBuffer)
using UnpackedMessage for further processing. Note You may have to convert an Array into a slice for ReceivedBuffer

In this case <b> []ReceivedBuffer </b> is the bytes you are trying to receive
