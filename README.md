A ShiViz compatible Logging Library in Go

This is small library you can add to any Go project to create a ShiViz Compatible Log. 

Files Included:

- <b>Govec Folder :</b> Contains the Library and all its dependencies <br>
- <b>TestFile :</b> A small program to Test the Library <br>
- <b>exampleprocess-log : </b>An example log generated by library
- <b>Experimental Development Folder :</b> A folder containing code used in development of this library and is of no consequence to the user <br>

API Info: 

The Library Supports 3 Major Calls:

<i>
- Initialize()<br>
- PrepareSend()<br>
- UnpackReceive()<br>
</i>

The calls are explained below

How to Use This Library

<b>Step 0:</b>
To Use This Library, copy the govec folder in your project/folder your go files are in. In your program, import it by adding this 

	"import ./govec"

to your import list.
	
<b>Step 1:</b>
Create a Global Variable and Initialize it using like this = 

	Logger:= govec.Initialize("MyProcessName",ShouldYouSeeLoggingOnScreen,ShouldISendVectorClockonWire,Debug)
	
- <b>MyProcessName</b> is where you name the local process. It should be unique to all other in the distributed system 	
- <b>ShouldYouSeeLoggingOnScreen</b> prints whatever is logged by the Library on Standard Output<br>
- <b>ShouldISendVectorClockonWire</b> should be true if all involved Networked Program are also using this library and false if
only you are logging on this locally running program<br>
- <b>Debug</b> prints extra information on Standard Output<br>

Note : Call Logger in any function by passing its pointer as an argument to the function. The variable Logger is of type GoLog so you pass it as (Logger *govec.GoLog)
	
<b>Step 2:</b>
When Ever You Decide to Send any []byte, call PrepareSend and send output. 
So instead of:

	connection.Write([]YourMessage)
call :

	connection.Send(Logger.PrepareSend("Message Description", []YourMessage))

In this case <b>[]YourMessage</b> are the bytes you are trying to send

<b>Step 3:</b>
When Receiveing a []byte Message, Unpack it with UnpackRecieve Call. 
So after you call :

	connection.Read([]RecievedBuffer)
call :
	
	[]UnpackedMessage :=  Logger.UnpackReceive("Message Description", []ReceivedBuffer)
using UnpackedMessage for further processing. Note You may have to convert an Array into a slice for ReceivedBuffer

In this case <b> []ReceivedBuffer </b> is the bytes you are trying to receive
